# Phylogenies, niches, and ranges: cacti respond idiosyncratically to climate change

Code:
* cleanTreeThompson.R: cleans and standardizes phylogenetic tree.
* synthesizeTree.R: prunes tree to match covariates data.
* getNicheSize.R: calculates niche sizes and niche densities.
* getRangeSizes.R: retrieves SDM-derived range sizes and range size changes.
* collateCovariates.R: organizes all trait data.
* partitionVariance.R: partitions between- and within-genus variance of traits.
* calcSignal.R: calculates and compares phylogenetic signal.
* phylComp.R: fits macroevolutionary models to trait, analyzes the relationship between niche size, density, range size, and range size changes.
